Description:

This plugin is used to retrieve EPG data into the VDR. The EPG data
was loaded from a mariadb database.

Setup Menu:
-----------

  Log level
      Logging level 0-4 { Errors, Infos, ..., Debug, ... }

  Update DVB EPG Database
      Master/Slave Mode (one client should be master, e.g. 24/7 Server, all others slave)
        - auto: Normally first VDR will be master - the master transfers the DVB events to the mariadb Server
        - yes: Master mode on
        - no: Master mode off
      Make sure that only one VDR will be master or you run into DB performance issues. Makes just sense, if you have different channels on your clients.

  epg2vdr.DbUser = epg2vdr
  epg2vdr.DbPass = epg


SVDRP Commands:
---------------

  The plugin provides SVDRP commands to control the plugin via command line or
  shell scripts.

  RELOAD      - Drop the whiole EPG and reload all events from the database
  UPDATE      - Trigger a update to load all new events from database


Installation:
-------------

- Patch the VDR. Patches found in patches/ since vdr 1.7.27.
  For Versions after 1.7.31 you need only the epghandler-segment-transfer.patch
  Sinve VDR 2.1.1 no patch is needed!

- Unpack the package into "PLUGINS/src" directory.
- Call "make plugins" in the VDR root directory.
- Start vdr with plugin epg2vdr (-Pepg2vdr) the database must running already

Create database and user:
--------------------------

already done when the epgd was installed!

HINTS:
------
- Don't load the epgtableid0 (epgtableid0 disables VDRs new EPG handler interface)
- Don't load the noepg plugin
(best you don't load any other epg manipulating plugin or patch if you not shure how they work together ;))
